To built the Tribute web page for legendary Sprinter "Milkha Singh" Ji , it was the great Challenging for me as a Non-tech person, Whereas this is the first Project to build as the web page. It tooks about more than 2 days  to complete , while doing so i gotta a several problems to build the project and to tackle all that things, surfing on the internet is the best Solutions for it. Where You can got several ideas and creativity by seeing that, you can add and impleament your own ideas into the projects.....


Problems which I face during project:

The color coding of all the title: 
Solution---> 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am little bit Confused What type of color should use for Titles I tried lot of colours but sometimes I miss-matches all the colors and it looks like a mess . 

Background image of page:
Solution----> 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Background image I Tried lot of solution but the problem is that i dont know about how to blur the background image in CSS with stucture of project. then finally i decided to blur the image bye edit format on mobile and then i add the image as background image.. i know this is not proper solutin for that as there should be another way for that in CSS .but it was looking awsome because of blur background image so i kept it as it is.
